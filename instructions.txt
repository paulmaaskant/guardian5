1.0 Introductions

  In this turn based strategy game the player commands a squad of 1 to 4 units,
  that are pitted against several waves of enemies in a series of missions.

2.0 Missions

  Each mission has one or more victory conditions. Once you meet all victory conditions, you will have achieved your mission. Typical victory conditions are:

  - Defeat all enemy units
  - Survive X number of rounds

  Likewise, each mission also has fail conditions. If one of the fail condition is met, then the mission has failed. Typical fail conditions are:

  - Time limit: X number of rounds have expired without victory
  - All player units have been destroyed

  As long as mission continues, the units on the map will take consecutive turns.

2.1 Taking Turns

  When the game assigns the turn to a unit, that unit becomes the ACTIVE UNIT. At the start of its turn, the ACTIVE UNIT gains a number of ACTION POINTS. The exact number varies per unit.

  The ACTIVE UNIT can perform ACTIONS, such as moving to another position on the map, or attacking an enemy unit. Each ACTION costs a number of ACTION POINTs to execute. Once the ACTIVE UNIT has spent all of its ACTION POINTS, its turn ends and the next unit will take a turn.

  Once all units have taken a turn, the current ROUND ends and a new ROUND starts. In some missions the number of expired ROUNDs serves a time limit.

2.4 Actions

  The ACTIVE UNIT can take one the following ACTIONS:

  MOVE - move the unit a number of positions up to its movement value (MOV).
  DOUBLE MOVE - move the unit a number of positions up to twice its movement value (MOV).
  WPN1, WPN2 - engage an enemy unit with the weapon in slot 1 or 2.
  CLOSE COMBAT - engage an enemy unit with a melee attack.
  CHARGE - run towards and engage an enemy unit with a melee attack.
  MARK - marks an enemy unit. This increases the chance of hitting the enemy unit for the rest of the round
  PIVOT TURN - Change the facing direction of the ACTIVE UNIT.
  BRACE - take a defensive stance to reduce incoming damage and end the turn

  Note that not all actions ACTIONS are always available. The availability of an ACTION depends on the position of the CURSOR, the number of remaining ACTION POINTS and the UNIT TYPE of the ACTIVE UNIT. Consider some examples:

  - The MOVE ACTIONS are only available if the cursor is on an empty map position
  - The CLOSE COMBAT action is only available if the target unit is in an adjacent map position
  - The CLOSE COMBAT action is not available for hovering units
  - The CHARGE action costs 2 ACTION POINTS and is not available when only 1 ACTION POINT remains

  Some actions can only be performed if certain conditions are met. If the conditions are not met, the action is blocked. A message appears in the HUD that explains why the action is blocked.

  - Attacking with a ranged WPN1 or WPN2 is only possible if the ACTIVE UNIT has line of sight to its target
  - Moving empty position is only possible if it is withing moving range
  - Attacking with a ranged WPN1 is only possible if it is not currently reloading

2.5 Heat

  If a unit uses an ACTION to attack, that unit will also incur a number of HEAT POINTs.
  Once a unit reaches a total of 6 HEAT POINTS, it will sustain 2 HEAT DAMAGE after each ACTION.
  A unit loses one HEAT POINT whenever it performs an action that is not an attack, e.g., MOVE or BRACE

2.6 Evade

  If a unit moves more than 4 spaces, it gains EVADE points, making it more difficult to hit by enemy units.
  A unit retains EVADE points until it's next turn; at the start of a unit's turn, it loses all EVADE points.
  After being the target of an attack, a unit loses one EVADE point.

2.7 Brace for impact

  Some units are able to to BRACE for impact, as an ACTION.
  Bracing for impact immediately ends a units turn and lasts until that unit's next turn.
  Units that are braced for impact reduce all incoming damage through front arc attacks by half.

2.8 Attacking a unit

  When attacking another unit, the chance of success is determined as follows

  - If the attack is a ranged attack, the base to-hit % is the ACCURACY of the attacking unit
  - If the attack is a close combat attack, the base to-hit % is the SKILL of the attacking unit
  - The to-hit chance is reduced by 10% for every EVADE POINT that the defending unit has
  - The to-hit change is increased by 10% if the defending unit is MARKED
  - If the attack angle is in the REAR arc of the defending unit, the to-hit chance is increased by 20%

  The angle of attack is determined by drawing a line from the attacking unit hexagon to the defending unit hexagon. This line crosses one of the 6 sides of the defending unit's hexagon.
  After an attack resolves, the defending unit loses one EVADE point, even if the attack missed.
