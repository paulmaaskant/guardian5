1.0 Introductions

  In this turn based strategy game the player commands a squad of 1 to 4 units,
  that are pitted against several waves of enemies in a series of missions.

2.0 Missions

  Each mission has one or more victory conditions. Once you meet all victory conditions, you will have achieved your mission. Typical victory conditions are:

  - Defeat all enemy units
  - Survive X number of rounds

  Likewise, each mission also has fail conditions. If one of the fail condition is met, then the mission has failed. Typical fail conditions are:

  - Time limit: X number of rounds have expired without victory
  - All player units have been destroyed

  As long as mission continues, the units on the map will take consecutive turns.

2.1 Taking Turns

  When the game assigns the turn to a unit, that unit becomes the ACTIVE UNIT. At the start of its turn, the ACTIVE UNIT gains a number of ACTION POINTS. The exact number varies per unit.

  The ACTIVE UNIT can perform ACTIONS, such as moving to another position on the map, or attacking an enemy unit. Each ACTION costs a number of ACTION POINTs to execute. Once the ACTIVE UNIT has spent all of its ACTION POINTS, its turn ends and the next unit will take a turn.

  Once all units have taken a turn, the current ROUND ends and a new ROUND starts. In some missions the number of expired ROUNDs serves a time limit.

2.4 Actions

  The ACTIVE UNIT can take one the following ACTIONS:

  MOVE - move the unit a number of positions up to its movement value.
  JUMP - move the unit a number of positions up to its movement value, ignoring obstacles
  SPRINT - move the unit a number of positions up to its movement value + 2.
  ATTACK - initiate a ranged attack targeting an enemy unit
  CLOSE COMBAT - engage an enemy unit with a melee attack.
  CHARGE - run towards and engage an enemy unit with a melee attack.
  MARK - marks an enemy unit. This increases the chance of hitting the enemy unit for the rest of the round
  PIVOT TURN - Change the facing direction of the ACTIVE UNIT.
  BRACE - take a defensive stance to reduce incoming damage and end the turn

  Note that not all actions ACTIONS are always available. The availability of an ACTION depends on the position of the CURSOR, the number of remaining ACTION POINTS and the UNIT TYPE of the ACTIVE UNIT. Consider some examples:

  - The MOVE ACTIONS are only available if the cursor is on an empty map position
  - The CLOSE COMBAT action is only available if the target unit is in an adjacent map position
  - The CLOSE COMBAT action is not available for hovering units
  - The CHARGE action costs 2 ACTION POINTS and is not available when only 1 ACTION POINT remains

  Some actions can only be performed if certain conditions are met. If the conditions are not met, the action is blocked. A message appears in the HUD that explains why the action is blocked.

  - an ATTACK is only possible if the ACTIVE UNIT has line of sight to its target
  - Moving empty position is only possible if it is withing moving range
  - Attacking with a ranged WPN1 is only possible if it is not currently reloading

2.5 Heat

  Some actions (like JUMPing) incurs heat points
  Once a unit reaches a total of 4 HEAT POINTS, it will sustain 2 DAMAGE after each ACTION.
  A unit loses one HEAT POINT whenever it BRACEs

2.6 Evade

  If a unit moves far enough it gain EVADE points, making it more difficult to be hit by enemy units.
  A unit retains EVADE points until it's next turn; at the start of a unit's turn, it loses all EVADE points.
  After being the target of an attack (regardless of its a hit or miss) a unit loses one EVADE point.

2.7 Brace for impact

  Some units are able to to BRACE for impact, as an ACTION.
  Bracing for impact immediately ends a units turn and loses one heat point.
  Units that are braced for impact reduce all incoming damage by 1, except damage coming in through its rear hex side
  A unit remains BRACEd until the start of the unit's next turn.

2.8 Attacking a unit

  When attacking another unit, the to-hit % depends on the following factors

  - the attacking pilot's skill level
  - whether the attacking unit moved in the same turn
  - the number of evade points on the targeted unit
  - the heat level of the attack mech

  The damage caused by a successful attack depends on the attacking unit's damage profile.
  Each unit has 4 damage values, indicating it's effectiveness at different ranges:

  CC - damage done in Close Combat (distance 1 hex)
  SR - damage done at Short Range (distance 2 or 3 hex)
  MR - damage done at Medium Range (distance 4, 5 or 6 hex)
  LR - damage done at Long Range (distance 4, 5 or 6 hex)

  The angle of attack is determined by drawing a line from the attacking unit hexagon to the defending unit hexagon. This line crosses one of the 6 sides of the defending unit's hexagon.
  When attacking a unit throug it's rear hex side, the attack causes +1 damage
  After an attack resolves, the defending unit loses one EVADE point, even if the attack missed.
